Social Entrepreneurs are individuals who are willing to create positive changes in society through their innovative ideas and efforts. They run their business or organization to achieve their goals by helping society. Their motto to start a business venture is primarily to help society and have no great intention of making personal profits. Their success is not always measured in terms of profit alone. A small change in the society out of their efforts is a success too. Social entrepreneurship is also referred to as altruistic entrepreneurship –which translates to selfless concern for the well-being of others.

There are many environmental and social problems out there and social entrepreneurs identify those problems and come up with innovative ways, and establish or adopt a business model around it. By presenting user-friendly and adaptable ideas to the local people, social entrepreneurs are generally looked up to as leaders or role models for driving philanthropic projects and bringing a large group of people to believe in their initiative. In the recent past, there have been many social entrepreneurs or philanthropists who have made immense success and proven to the public that not all needs of society are to be solved by the Government. Any person with a vision and the ability to bring change can do it.
